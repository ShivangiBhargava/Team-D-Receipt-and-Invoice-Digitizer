Project Details - Businesses and individuals handle numerous paper receipts and invoices, which are prone to loss, errors, and manual entry delays. This project builds a system that automatically scans, extracts, and digitizes information from receipts and invoices using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and NLP-based field extraction. The digitized data is stored in a structured format, making it easy to search, analyze, and integrate with accounting or ERP systems.
